django-bootstrap
================

Boilerplate of a simple django new-project with Bootstrap, a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

To use it, you need to install a django valid version (1.4+ recommended). This can be done by:
        pip install django

To check your current version of django, do the following on an open terminal:
        python
        >>> import django
        >>> django.VERSION
